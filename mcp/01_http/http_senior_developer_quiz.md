## Question 1: Performance Optimization Scenario

**Scenario:** You're optimizing a high-traffic e-commerce API that serves product data. The API receives 10,000 requests per second and you notice 40% of requests are for the same product data. Your current implementation doesn't use caching effectively.

**Code Example:**

```python
@app.route('/api/products/<product_id>')
def get_product(product_id):
    # Current implementation - no caching
    product = database.query(f"SELECT * FROM products WHERE id = {product_id}")
    return jsonify(product)
```

**Question:** Which HTTP caching strategy would be most effective for this scenario?

```json
{
  "question": "You need to implement caching for a high-traffic product API. Which approach would be most effective?",
  "options": [
    "Add 'Cache-Control: public, max-age=3600' to all responses",
    "Implement ETags with 'If-None-Match' validation",
    "Use 'Cache-Control: immutable' for product data that rarely changes",
    "Implement 'stale-while-revalidate' with a CDN"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": "Implement 'stale-while-revalidate' with a CDN",
  "explanation": "For high-traffic APIs, 'stale-while-revalidate' with a CDN provides the best performance. It serves cached responses immediately while updating the cache in the background, reducing latency and server load. This is especially effective for product data that changes infrequently but needs to be served quickly."
}
```

## Question 2: Security Implementation Challenge

**Scenario:** You're building a banking application that needs to handle sensitive financial data. You must implement proper security headers and prevent common web vulnerabilities.

**Code Example:**

```javascript
// Current Express.js server setup
app.use(helmet()); // Basic security headers

app.get("/api/account/balance", (req, res) => {
  // Returns sensitive financial data
  res.json({ balance: userAccount.balance });
});
```

**Question:** Which security headers should you implement for this banking application?

```json
{
  "question": "For a banking application handling sensitive financial data, which security headers are most critical?",
  "options": [
    "Content-Security-Policy, X-Frame-Options, HSTS",
    "Cache-Control: no-store, Authorization, X-Content-Type-Options",
    "Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy, Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy, Permissions-Policy",
    "All of the above plus additional banking-specific headers"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": "All of the above plus additional banking-specific headers",
  "explanation": "Banking applications require comprehensive security. CSP prevents XSS, X-Frame-Options prevents clickjacking, HSTS enforces HTTPS, COEP/COOP provide isolation, and Permissions-Policy controls feature access. Additionally, implement 'Cache-Control: no-store' for sensitive data and proper authentication headers."
}
```

## Question 3: HTTP/2 Implementation Problem

**Scenario:** You're migrating a legacy HTTP/1.1 application to HTTP/2. The application currently makes 50+ requests per page load due to resource bundling limitations.

**Current HTTP/1.1 Implementation:**

```nginx
# Current nginx configuration
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name example.com;

    # Multiple resource locations
    location /css/ { expires 1y; }
    location /js/ { expires 1y; }
    location /images/ { expires 1y; }
}
```

**Question:** How should you optimize this for HTTP/2?

```json
{
  "question": "When migrating to HTTP/2, how should you optimize the resource loading strategy?",
  "options": [
    "Keep the same bundling strategy since HTTP/2 handles multiple requests efficiently",
    "Unbundle resources and use HTTP/2 Server Push for critical resources",
    "Implement aggressive bundling to reduce the number of requests",
    "Use HTTP/2 prioritization with separate resource domains"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": "Unbundle resources and use HTTP/2 Server Push for critical resources",
  "explanation": "HTTP/2's multiplexing makes multiple small requests efficient. Unbundle resources and use Server Push for critical CSS/JS files. This allows better caching (individual files can be cached separately) and parallel loading. Server Push can preemptively send critical resources."
}
```

## Question 4: Debugging Complex CORS Issue

**Scenario:** Your frontend application is experiencing intermittent CORS errors when making requests to your API. The errors occur randomly and seem to affect different users at different times.

**Error Log:**

```
CORS error: Access to fetch at 'https://api.example.com/data' from origin 'https://app.example.com' has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.
```

**Current CORS Configuration:**

```python
# Flask-CORS configuration
CORS(app, origins=['https://app.example.com'],
     methods=['GET', 'POST', 'PUT', 'DELETE'],
     allow_headers=['Content-Type', 'Authorization'])
```

**Question:** What's the most likely cause of this intermittent CORS issue?

```json
{
  "question": "What's causing the intermittent CORS errors in this scenario?",
  "options": [
    "Missing preflight request handling",
    "Load balancer stripping CORS headers",
    "Incorrect origin validation",
    "Browser cache issues with CORS headers"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": "Load balancer stripping CORS headers",
  "explanation": "Intermittent CORS errors often indicate that a load balancer or proxy is stripping CORS headers from some responses. This happens when the load balancer doesn't properly forward the 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header. Check your load balancer configuration and ensure it preserves all response headers."
}
```

## Question 5: API Rate Limiting Implementation

**Scenario:** You need to implement rate limiting for a public API that should allow 100 requests per minute per IP address, with different limits for authenticated users (1000 requests per minute).

**Current Implementation:**

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import redis
import time

app = Flask(__name__)
redis_client = redis.Redis()

@app.route('/api/data')
def get_data():
    client_ip = request.remote_addr
    key = f"rate_limit:{client_ip}"

    # Current rate limiting logic
    current = redis_client.get(key)
    if current and int(current) >= 100:
        return jsonify({"error": "Rate limit exceeded"}), 429

    redis_client.incr(key)
    redis_client.expire(key, 60)

    return jsonify({"data": "success"})
```

**Question:** What's wrong with this rate limiting implementation?

```json
{
  "question": "What's the main issue with this rate limiting implementation?",
  "options": [
    "It doesn't handle authenticated users differently",
    "It uses a sliding window instead of fixed window",
    "It doesn't include proper HTTP headers for rate limiting",
    "All of the above issues"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": "All of the above issues",
  "explanation": "The implementation has multiple issues: 1) No differentiation between authenticated/unauthenticated users, 2) Uses fixed window (can allow bursts), 3) Missing 'X-RateLimit-*' headers, 4) No 'Retry-After' header. A proper implementation should use sliding windows, check authentication, and include proper headers."
}
```

## Question 6: HTTP/3 Migration Strategy

**Scenario:** Your company wants to migrate to HTTP/3 for better performance. You're running a microservices architecture with multiple services communicating via HTTP.

**Current Architecture:**

```
Client ‚Üí Load Balancer ‚Üí API Gateway ‚Üí Microservices
```

**Question:** What's the best migration strategy for HTTP/3?

```json
{
  "question": "What's the optimal HTTP/3 migration strategy for this microservices architecture?",
  "options": [
    "Migrate all services simultaneously to HTTP/3",
    "Start with the API Gateway and use Alt-Svc headers",
    "Migrate only the client-facing load balancer",
    "Implement HTTP/3 only for internal service communication"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": "Start with the API Gateway and use Alt-Svc headers",
  "explanation": "The best approach is gradual migration starting with the API Gateway. Use Alt-Svc headers to advertise HTTP/3 availability, allowing clients to upgrade when supported. This provides immediate benefits for client connections while maintaining backward compatibility and allowing gradual internal service migration."
}
```

## Question 7: Advanced Caching Strategy

**Scenario:** You're building a content management system where articles can be updated by multiple authors. You need to ensure users always see the latest content while maintaining good performance.

**Current Caching Implementation:**

```python
@app.route('/api/articles/<article_id>')
def get_article(article_id):
    # Current caching logic
    cache_key = f"article:{article_id}"
    cached_article = redis.get(cache_key)

    if cached_article:
        return jsonify(json.loads(cached_article))

    article = database.get_article(article_id)
    redis.setex(cache_key, 3600, json.dumps(article))
    return jsonify(article)
```

**Question:** How should you implement cache invalidation for this scenario?

```json
{
  "question": "What's the best cache invalidation strategy for a multi-author CMS?",
  "options": [
    "Use ETags with database timestamps",
    "Implement cache warming after article updates",
    "Use cache tags and bulk invalidation",
    "Implement version-based cache keys"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": "Use version-based cache keys",
  "explanation": "Version-based cache keys (e.g., 'article:123:v2') are ideal for multi-author CMS. When an article is updated, increment the version number. This ensures users always get the latest content while maintaining cache performance. Old versions can be cleaned up asynchronously."
}
```

## Question 8: Security Header Implementation

**Scenario:** You're implementing security headers for a web application that includes user-generated content and third-party integrations.

**Current Security Configuration:**

```python
# Current security headers
SECURITY_HEADERS = {
    'X-Frame-Options': 'DENY',
    'X-Content-Type-Options': 'nosniff',
    'X-XSS-Protection': '1; mode=block',
    'Strict-Transport-Security': 'max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains'
}
```

**Question:** What additional security headers should you implement?

```json
{
  "question": "What additional security headers are needed for user-generated content?",
  "options": [
    "Content-Security-Policy with nonce-based scripts",
    "Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy and Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy",
    "Permissions-Policy for feature restrictions",
    "All of the above plus Referrer-Policy"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": "All of the above plus Referrer-Policy",
  "explanation": "User-generated content requires comprehensive security. CSP with nonces prevents XSS, COEP/COOP provide isolation, Permissions-Policy restricts features, and Referrer-Policy controls information leakage. This creates multiple layers of protection against various attack vectors."
}
```

## Question 9: Performance Monitoring Implementation

**Scenario:** You need to implement comprehensive HTTP performance monitoring for a production application. You want to track response times, error rates, and identify bottlenecks.

**Current Monitoring Setup:**

@app.after_request
def log_request(response):
    duration = time.time() - g.start
    logger.info(f"{request.method} {request.path} - {response.status_code} - {duration}s")
    return response
```

**Question:** What additional metrics should you track?

```json
{
  "question": "What additional HTTP metrics are critical for production monitoring?",
  "options": [
    "Request size, response size, and bandwidth usage",
    "Cache hit rates, ETag validation frequency, and compression ratios",
    "HTTP/2 stream utilization and connection reuse",
    "All of the above plus custom business metrics"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": "All of the above plus custom business metrics",
  "explanation": "Comprehensive monitoring should include: request/response sizes, cache performance, HTTP/2 metrics, compression effectiveness, and business-specific metrics. This provides complete visibility into HTTP performance and helps identify optimization opportunities."
}
```

    "Implement header-based versioning with Accept-Version",
    "Use content negotiation with different media types",
    "Combine URL versioning with semantic versioning in headers"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": "Combine URL versioning with semantic versioning in headers",
  "explanation": "The best approach combines URL versioning for major changes with semantic versioning in headers for minor updates. Use 'API-Version' headers for precise version control and 'Deprecation' headers to notify clients of upcoming changes. This provides flexibility and clear migration paths."
}
```

## Question 11: Load Balancer Configuration

    cached_user = cache.get(cache_key)

    if cached_user:
        return jsonify(cached_user)

    user = database.get_user(user_id)
    cache.setex(cache_key, 3600, user.to_dict())
    return jsonify(user.to_dict())
```

**Question:** What's the optimal caching strategy for this API?

```json
{
  "question": "What's the optimal caching strategy for this user API?",

}
```

## Question 29: Performance Monitoring Implementation

**Scenario:** You need to implement comprehensive performance monitoring for your HTTP application to track response times, error rates, and identify performance bottlenecks.

**Current Monitoring:**

```python
# Basic timing middleware
@app.before_request
def start_timer():
    g.start = time.time()

@app.after_request
def log_timing(response):
    duration = time.time() - g.start
    logger.info(f"Request took {duration}s")
    return response
```

**Question:** What additional monitoring should you implement?
