```json
{
  "question": "Which HTTP method is used to delete a resource from the server?",
  "options": ["GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE"],
  "correctAnswer": "DELETE",
  "explanation": "The DELETE method is used to remove a specified resource from the server. It requests that the server delete the resource identified by the URI."
}
```

## Question 18

```json
{
  "question": "What is the purpose of the 'Connection: keep-alive' header?",
  "options": [
    "To keep the user logged in",

{
  "question": "What does the HTTP status code 204 mean?",
  "options": [
    "No content to return",
    "Request successful",
    "Resource created",
    "Page not found"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": "No content to return",
  "explanation": "Status code 204 means 'No Content' - the server successfully processed the request but there is no content to return in the response body. Common after DELETE requests."
}
```

## Question 30

```json
{
  "question": "What is the main characteristic of HTTP that makes it 'stateless'?",
  "options": [
    "It doesn't use encryption",
    "Each request is independent and contains all necessary information",
    "It only works with text data",
    "It requires authentication for every request"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": "Each request is independent and contains all necessary information",
