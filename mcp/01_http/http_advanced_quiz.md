---

## Question 1

```json
{
  "question": "What is the difference between HTTP/2's Server Push and HTTP/3's Server Push?",
  "options": [
    "HTTP/3 doesn't support Server Push",
    "HTTP/3 Server Push uses QUIC streams instead of HTTP/2 frames",
    "HTTP/2 Server Push is faster",
    "HTTP/3 Server Push requires different headers"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": "HTTP/3 Server Push uses QUIC streams instead of HTTP/2 frames",
  "explanation": "HTTP/3 Server Push uses QUIC streams (bidirectional byte streams) rather than HTTP/2's frame-based approach. This provides better flow control and eliminates stream-level Head-of-Line blocking that can still occur in HTTP/2."
}
```

## Question 2

```json
{
  "question": "What is the purpose of the 'Alt-Svc' header in HTTP responses?",
  "options": [
    "To specify alternative services for the same resource",
    "To indicate server availability",
    "To specify content encoding alternatives",
    "To provide authentication alternatives"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": "To specify alternative services for the same resource",
  "explanation": "Alt-Svc (Alternative Services) allows servers to advertise alternative endpoints for the same resource, such as HTTP/3 endpoints or different protocols. This enables protocol negotiation and service discovery."
}
```

## Question 3

```json
{
  "question": "What is the difference between 'Cache-Control: immutable' and 'Cache-Control: max-age'?",
  "options": [
    "Immutable is for static files, max-age is for dynamic content",
    "Immutable tells browsers the resource will never change, max-age sets a time limit",
    "Immutable is faster, max-age is slower",
    "Immutable requires revalidation, max-age doesn't"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": "Immutable tells browsers the resource will never change, max-age sets a time limit",
  "explanation": "'immutable' indicates the resource will never change, so browsers can skip revalidation entirely. 'max-age' sets a time limit after which the cache entry expires and must be revalidated."
}
```

## Question 4

```json
{
  "question": "What is the purpose of the 'Link' header with 'rel=preload'?",
  "options": [
    "To preload critical resources",
    "To indicate linked resources",
    "To specify content relationships",
    "To provide authentication links"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": "To preload critical resources",
  "explanation": "The Link header with 'rel=preload' tells browsers to fetch and cache resources early, even before they're needed. This improves performance by reducing the critical rendering path."
}
```

## Question 5

```json
{
  "question": "What is the difference between HTTP/2's HPACK and HTTP/3's QPACK compression?",
  "options": [
    "QPACK is faster but less efficient",
    "QPACK is designed for QUIC's stream-based nature",
    "HPACK is more secure",
    "QPACK doesn't support dynamic tables"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": "QPACK is designed for QUIC's stream-based nature",
  "explanation": "QPACK is specifically designed for QUIC's stream-based architecture, handling the challenges of compressing headers across multiple streams where packet loss can affect different streams independently."
}
```

## Question 6

```json
{
  "question": "What is the purpose of the 'Early-Data' header in HTTP requests?",
  "options": [
    "To indicate 0-RTT data",
    "To specify early content",
    "To request fast responses",
    "To indicate protocol version"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": "To indicate 0-RTT data",
  "explanation": "The Early-Data header indicates that the request was sent as 0-RTT data (before the TLS handshake completed). This helps servers identify and handle such requests appropriately, often with additional validation."
}
```

## Question 7

```json
{
  "question": "What is the difference between 'Cache-Control: stale-while-revalidate' and 'Cache-Control: stale-if-error'?",
  "options": [
    "stale-while-revalidate is for errors, stale-if-error is for revalidation",
    "stale-while-revalidate serves stale content during revalidation, stale-if-error serves stale content on errors",
    "stale-while-revalidate is faster",
    "stale-if-error is more secure"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": "stale-while-revalidate serves stale content during revalidation, stale-if-error serves stale content on errors",
  "explanation": "'stale-while-revalidate' allows serving stale content while revalidating in the background. 'stale-if-error' allows serving stale content only when the server returns an error."
}
```

## Question 8

```json
{
  "question": "What is the purpose of the 'Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy' header?",
  "options": [
    "To control cross-origin embedding",
    "To enable SharedArrayBuffer and other features",
    "To specify CORS policies",
    "To control frame embedding"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": "To enable SharedArrayBuffer and other features",
  "explanation": "COEP (Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy) enables features like SharedArrayBuffer by ensuring all resources are either same-origin or explicitly marked as CORS-enabled, creating a secure context."
}
```

## Question 9

```json
{
  "question": "What is the difference between HTTP/2's PRIORITY frame and HTTP/3's stream prioritization?",
  "options": [
    "HTTP/3 doesn't support prioritization",
    "HTTP/3 uses QUIC's native stream prioritization",
    "HTTP/2 prioritization is more efficient",
    "HTTP/3 requires different priority headers"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": "HTTP/3 uses QUIC's native stream prioritization",
  "explanation": "HTTP/3 leverages QUIC's built-in stream prioritization mechanisms rather than HTTP/2's separate PRIORITY frames, providing more efficient and flexible prioritization."
}
```

    "To control CORS policies"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": "To provide security context for requests",

}
```

## Question 11

```json
{
  "question": "What is the difference between 'Content-Security-Policy' and 'Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only'?",
  "options": [
    "Report-Only is for testing, CSP is for enforcement",
    "CSP is stricter",
    "Report-Only doesn't block violations",
    "CSP is faster"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": "Report-Only doesn't block violations",
  "explanation": "CSP-Report-Only monitors violations and sends reports but doesn't block content. Regular CSP actively blocks violations. Report-Only is useful for testing policies before enforcement."
}
```

}
```

## Question 13

```json
{
  "question": "What is the difference between HTTP/2's flow control and HTTP/3's flow control?",

    "HTTP/2 flow control is more efficient",
    "HTTP/3 requires different flow control headers"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": "HTTP/3 has both connection-level and stream-level flow control",
  "explanation": "HTTP/3 implements flow control at both the QUIC connection level and individual stream level, providing more granular control than HTTP/2's stream-only flow control."
}
```

## Question 14

  "question": "What is the purpose of the 'Permissions-Policy' header?",
  "options": [
    "To control browser permissions",

}
```

## Question 15

```json
{
  "question": "What is the difference between 'Cache-Control: must-understand' and 'Cache-Control: proxy-revalidate'?",

    "must-understand requires caches to understand the directive, proxy-revalidate applies only to proxy caches",
    "must-understand is stricter",
    "proxy-revalidate is faster"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": "must-understand requires caches to understand the directive, proxy-revalidate applies only to proxy caches",
  "explanation": "'must-understand' requires caches to understand and follow the directive or return an error. 'proxy-revalidate' applies revalidation rules only to proxy caches, not user agent caches."
}
```

}
```

## Question 17

```json
{
  "question": "What is the difference between HTTP/2's SETTINGS frame and HTTP/3's transport parameters?",
  "options": [
    "HTTP/3 doesn't have settings",
    "HTTP/3 uses QUIC transport parameters instead of HTTP/2 settings",
    "HTTP/2 settings are more flexible",
    "HTTP/3 requires different configuration"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": "HTTP/3 uses QUIC transport parameters instead of HTTP/2 settings",
  "explanation": "HTTP/3 uses QUIC's transport parameters (negotiated during the handshake) rather than HTTP/2's SETTINGS frames, providing similar functionality but integrated with the transport layer."
}
```

## Question 18

    "no-cache is more secure"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": "only-if-cached only uses cached responses, no-cache requires revalidation",

{
  "question": "What is the difference between 'Cache-Control: no-transform' and 'Cache-Control: no-store'?",
  "options": [
    "no-transform prevents modifications, no-store prevents caching",
    "no-transform is for proxies, no-store is for browsers",
    "no-transform is stricter",
    "no-store is faster"
