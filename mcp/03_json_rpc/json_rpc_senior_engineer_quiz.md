---

## Question 1: Real-Time Trading System Architecture

```json
{
  "scenario": "You're designing a real-time trading system that processes 50,000+ orders per second with strict latency requirements (<1ms). The system needs to handle market data feeds, order execution, and risk management. Which JSON-RPC architecture would you implement?",
  "options": [
    "Single JSON-RPC server with all trading logic",
    "Microservices with JSON-RPC over HTTP for all communication",
    "Hybrid architecture: JSON-RPC for control, binary protocol for market data",
    "Event-driven architecture with JSON-RPC notifications only"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": "Hybrid architecture: JSON-RPC for control, binary protocol for market data",
  "explanation": "For high-frequency trading, a hybrid approach is optimal. Use JSON-RPC for control operations (order placement, risk checks) and binary protocols for market data feeds. This provides the flexibility of JSON-RPC for complex operations while achieving the performance needed for real-time data."
}
```

## Question 2: Distributed System Consistency Challenge

```json
{
  "scenario": "Your JSON-RPC system spans 5 data centers across continents. Users can place orders from any region, but you need to ensure order consistency and prevent double-booking. What consistency strategy would you implement?",

}
```

## Question 3: API Gateway Performance Bottleneck

```json
{
  "scenario": "Your JSON-RPC API gateway is experiencing 500ms+ latency under load. Analysis shows JSON parsing/serialization is the bottleneck. The gateway handles 100,000 requests/minute. What optimization strategy would you implement?",
  "options": [

    "Implement protocol buffers with JSON-RPC compatibility",
    "Use MessagePack with JSON-RPC structure and connection pooling",
    "Add more gateway instances with load balancing"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": "Use MessagePack with JSON-RPC structure and connection pooling",
