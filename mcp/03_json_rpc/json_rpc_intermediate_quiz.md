---

## Question 1

```json
{
  "question": "What is the optimal transport protocol for JSON-RPC when you need real-time bidirectional communication?",
  "options": [
    "HTTP with polling",
    "WebSockets",
    "TCP with custom framing",
    "HTTP/2 with Server-Sent Events"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": "WebSockets",
  "explanation": "WebSockets are optimal for real-time bidirectional JSON-RPC communication because they provide persistent connections, low latency, and support both client-to-server and server-to-client messaging without the overhead of HTTP headers for each message."
}
```

## Question 2

```json
{
  "question": "What is the purpose of the 'data' field in a JSON-RPC Error object?",
  "options": [
    "To specify the error type",
    "To provide additional context or debugging information",
    "To identify the error source",
    "To specify the error severity"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": "To provide additional context or debugging information",
  "explanation": "The 'data' field in a JSON-RPC Error object is optional and provides additional context or debugging information about the error. It can contain any JSON value that might help the client understand or handle the error better."
}
```

## Question 3

```json
{
  "question": "What is the correct way to handle a JSON-RPC batch request that contains a mix of calls and notifications?",
  "options": [
    "Process only the calls and ignore notifications",
    "Process calls and notifications in order, return responses only for calls",
    "Process all requests in parallel",
    "Reject the entire batch if it contains notifications"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": "Process calls and notifications in order, return responses only for calls",
  "explanation": "When processing a batch request with mixed calls and notifications, the server should process all requests (both calls and notifications) but only return responses for the calls. Notifications don't get responses, so they're processed but not included in the response array."
}
```

## Question 4

```json
{
  "question": "What is the optimal strategy for implementing JSON-RPC over HTTP for high-traffic APIs?",
  "options": [
    "Use GET requests for all JSON-RPC calls",
    "Use POST requests with proper Content-Type headers",
    "Use PUT requests for stateful operations",
    "Use different HTTP methods based on the RPC method"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": "Use POST requests with proper Content-Type headers",
  "explanation": "Using POST requests with proper Content-Type headers (application/json) is optimal for JSON-RPC over HTTP because it allows for complex parameter structures, follows HTTP semantics for data submission, and works well with load balancers and proxies."
}
```

## Question 5

```json
{
  "question": "What is the purpose of implementing custom error codes in the -32000 to -32099 range?",
  "options": [
    "To override standard JSON-RPC error codes",
    "To provide application-specific error information",
    "To improve error handling performance",
    "To reduce error message size"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": "To provide application-specific error information",
  "explanation": "Custom error codes in the -32000 to -32099 range are reserved for implementation-defined server errors. They allow servers to provide application-specific error information while maintaining compatibility with the JSON-RPC specification."
}
```

## Question 6

```json

    "Embed authentication in the method name",
    "Use custom JSON-RPC headers"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": "Use HTTP Authorization headers with the JSON-RPC payload",
  "explanation": "Using HTTP Authorization headers with the JSON-RPC payload is optimal because it separates authentication concerns from the RPC protocol, follows HTTP standards, and works well with existing authentication mechanisms like OAuth, API keys, or JWT tokens."
