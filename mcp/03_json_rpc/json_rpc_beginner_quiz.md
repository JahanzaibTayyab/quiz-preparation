---

## Question 1

```json
{
  "question": "What does JSON-RPC stand for?",
  "options": [
    "JavaScript Object Notation Remote Procedure Call",
    "JSON Remote Protocol Communication",
    "JavaScript Remote Procedure Call",
    "JSON Remote Process Communication"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": "JavaScript Object Notation Remote Procedure Call",
  "explanation": "JSON-RPC stands for JavaScript Object Notation Remote Procedure Call. It's a lightweight, stateless protocol that uses JSON as its data format to enable remote procedure calls between clients and servers."
}
```

## Question 2

```json
{
  "question": "What version of JSON-RPC is currently the standard?",
  "options": ["1.0", "2.0", "3.0", "1.5"],
  "correctAnswer": "2.0",
  "explanation": "JSON-RPC 2.0 is the current standard version. It was designed to be simple, lightweight, and transport-agnostic, making it suitable for various communication protocols like HTTP, WebSockets, and TCP."
}
```

## Question 3

```json
{
  "question": "What is the purpose of the 'jsonrpc' field in a JSON-RPC request?",
  "options": [
    "To specify the JSON format",
    "To specify the protocol version",
    "To identify the request type",
    "To specify the transport method"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": "To specify the protocol version",
  "explanation": "The 'jsonrpc' field specifies the version of the JSON-RPC protocol being used. For JSON-RPC 2.0, this field MUST be exactly '2.0' to indicate compliance with the 2.0 specification."
}
```

## Question 4

```json
{
  "question": "Which field in a JSON-RPC request contains the name of the method to be invoked?",
  "options": ["function", "method", "call", "procedure"],
  "correctAnswer": "method",
  "explanation": "The 'method' field contains the name of the method to be invoked on the server. This is a string that identifies which remote procedure the client wants to execute."
}
```

## Question 5

```json
{
  "question": "What is the purpose of the 'params' field in a JSON-RPC request?",
  "options": [
    "To specify the protocol parameters",
    "To hold the parameters for the method being called",
    "To specify the response format",
    "To identify the request type"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": "To hold the parameters for the method being called",
  "explanation": "The 'params' field holds the parameters that will be passed to the method being called. It can be either an array (for positional parameters) or an object (for named parameters), and can be omitted if the method doesn't require parameters."
}
```

## Question 6

```json
{
  "question": "What is the purpose of the 'id' field in a JSON-RPC request?",
  "options": [
    "To identify the server",
    "To identify the client",
    "To correlate requests with responses",
    "To specify the request type"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": "To correlate requests with responses",
  "explanation": "The 'id' field is used to correlate requests with their corresponding responses. It can be a string, number, or null. If omitted, the request becomes a notification (one-way communication)."
}
```

## Question 7

```json
{
  "question": "What is a JSON-RPC notification?",
  "options": [
    "A server-to-client message",
    "A request without an 'id' field",
    "An error message",
    "A response message"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": "A request without an 'id' field",
  "explanation": "A JSON-RPC notification is a request object that does not include the 'id' field. When a client sends a notification, it's not interested in a response from the server, and the server MUST NOT reply to it."
}
```

## Question 8

```json
{
  "question": "What are the two ways to structure parameters in JSON-RPC?",
  "options": [
    "By position and by name",
    "By type and by value",
    "By order and by key",
    "By index and by property"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": "By position and by name",
  "explanation": "JSON-RPC supports two parameter structures: by-position (using an array where each value corresponds to a parameter in order) and by-name (using an object where each key-value pair represents a named parameter)."
}
```

## Question 9

```json
{
  "question": "What is the correct format for a JSON-RPC request with positional parameters?",
  "options": [
    "{\"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\", \"method\": \"add\", \"params\": [1, 2], \"id\": 1}",
    "{\"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\", \"method\": \"add\", \"params\": {\"a\": 1, \"b\": 2}, \"id\": 1}",
    "{\"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\", \"method\": \"add\", \"args\": [1, 2], \"id\": 1}",
    "{\"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\", \"function\": \"add\", \"params\": [1, 2], \"id\": 1}"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": "{\"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\", \"method\": \"add\", \"params\": [1, 2], \"id\": 1}",

  "options": [
    "To indicate success",
    "To hold the return value from the method",
    "To specify the response type",
    "To identify the response"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": "To hold the return value from the method",
  "explanation": "The 'result' field in a JSON-RPC response holds the return value from the method that was invoked. It's required on success and contains the actual data returned by the remote procedure."
}
```

## Question 12

```json
{
  "question": "What is the purpose of the 'error' field in a JSON-RPC response?",

    "A single request with multiple methods",
    "Multiple responses sent together"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": "An array of Request objects sent together",
  "explanation": "A batch request in JSON-RPC is an array of Request objects sent together. The server processes all requests and responds with an array of corresponding Response objects."
}
```

## Question 23

```json
{
  "question": "How does the server process batch requests in JSON-RPC?",
  "options": [
    "Sequentially in order",
    "In parallel, responses in same order",
    "In any order, responses can be in any order",
    "Only the first request is processed"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": "In any order, responses can be in any order",
  "explanation": "The server can process batch requests in any order, and the responses can also be in any order. The client should use the 'id' of each request to match it with its corresponding response."
}
```

## Question 24

```json
{
  "question": "What is the correct format for a JSON-RPC notification?",
  "options": [
    "{\"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\", \"method\": \"update\", \"params\": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]}",

}
```

## Question 25

```json
{
  "question": "What happens when a server receives a JSON-RPC notification?",
  "options": [
    "It must send an acknowledgment response",
    "It must not reply",
    "It can optionally send a response",
    "It must send an error response"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": "It must not reply",
  "explanation": "When a server receives a JSON-RPC notification (a request without an 'id' field), it MUST NOT reply. This is because notifications are designed for one-way communication where the client doesn't expect a response."
}
```

## Question 26

```json
{
  "question": "What is the purpose of the 'data' field in a JSON-RPC Error object?",
  "options": [
    "To specify the error type",

  "options": [
    "Methods starting with 'rpc.'",
    "Methods starting with 'json.'",
    "Methods starting with 'system.'",
    "Methods starting with 'internal.'"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": "Methods starting with 'rpc.'",
  "explanation": "Method names that start with 'rpc.' are reserved for system extensions in JSON-RPC and should not be used for application-specific methods. This prevents conflicts with future protocol extensions."
}
```

## Question 28

```json
{
  "question": "Is JSON-RPC transport-agnostic?",
  "options": [
    "No, it only works over HTTP",
    "Yes, it can work over any transport",
    "No, it only works over WebSockets",
    "Yes, but only over TCP-based protocols"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": "Yes, it can work over any transport",
  "explanation": "JSON-RPC is transport-agnostic, meaning it can be used over HTTP, WebSockets, TCP, or any other message-passing environment. The protocol itself doesn't depend on any specific transport mechanism."
}
```

## Question 29

```json
{
  "question": "What is the main advantage of JSON-RPC over other RPC protocols?",
  "options": [
    "It's faster than other protocols",
