- Read the explanation after answering to understand the concept better
- This quiz covers intermediate-level REST concepts

---

## Question 1

```json
{
  "question": "What is the difference between PUT and PATCH in REST?",
  "options": [
    "PUT is faster than PATCH",
    "PUT replaces the entire resource, PATCH updates specific fields",
    "PUT is for creation, PATCH is for updates",
    "PUT is idempotent, PATCH is not"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": "PUT replaces the entire resource, PATCH updates specific fields",
  "explanation": "PUT replaces the entire resource with the provided representation, while PATCH applies partial modifications to a resource. PUT requires the complete resource state, while PATCH only needs the fields to be updated."
}
```

## Question 2

```json
{
  "question": "What is the purpose of the 'Link' header in REST responses?",
  "options": [
    "To specify the server location",
    "To provide HATEOAS navigation links",
    "To link to external resources",
    "To specify the content type"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": "To provide HATEOAS navigation links",
  "explanation": "The Link header provides HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State) navigation links. It tells clients what actions are available and how to navigate the API, making the API self-documenting and discoverable."
}
```

## Question 3

```json
{
  "question": "What is the purpose of the 'Prefer' header in REST requests?",
  "options": [
    "To specify preferred content type",
    "To indicate client preferences for server behavior",
    "To specify preferred authentication method",
    "To indicate preferred server location"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": "To indicate client preferences for server behavior",
  "explanation": "The Prefer header allows clients to indicate their preferences for how the server should behave. For example, 'Prefer: return=minimal' asks the server to return minimal response data, or 'Prefer: respond-async' for asynchronous processing."
}
```

## Question 4

```json
{
  "question": "What is the purpose of the 'If-Match' header in REST?",
  "options": [
    "To match request and response formats",
    "To implement optimistic concurrency control",
    "To match client and server versions",
    "To match authentication tokens"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": "To implement optimistic concurrency control",
  "explanation": "The If-Match header implements optimistic concurrency control. It contains an ETag value, and the server will only process the request if the resource's current ETag matches the provided value, preventing conflicts when multiple clients modify the same resource."
}
```

## Question 5

```json
{
  "question": "What is the purpose of the 'If-Unmodified-Since' header?",
  "options": [
    "To check if the server has been modified",
    "To conditionally update a resource only if it hasn't changed since a specific time",
    "To check if the client has been modified",
    "To specify when the request was created"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": "To conditionally update a resource only if it hasn't changed since a specific time",
  "explanation": "The If-Unmodified-Since header allows conditional updates. The server will only process the request if the resource hasn't been modified since the specified date, preventing overwriting changes made by other clients."
}
```

## Question 6

```json
{
  "question": "What is the purpose of the 'Vary' header in REST responses?",
  "options": [
    "To vary the response format",
    "To indicate which request headers affect the response",
    "To vary the server location",
    "To indicate response variations"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": "To indicate which request headers affect the response",
  "explanation": "The Vary header tells caches which request headers affect the response content. For example, 'Vary: Accept-Language' indicates that responses may differ based on the Accept-Language header, helping caches store appropriate versions."
}
```

## Question 7

```json
{
  "question": "What is the purpose of the 'Retry-After' header?",
  "options": [
    "To indicate when to retry a failed request",
    "To specify the retry count",
    "To indicate server retry behavior",
    "To specify retry intervals"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": "To indicate when to retry a failed request",
  "explanation": "The Retry-After header tells clients when they can retry a request after receiving a 429 (Too Many Requests) or 503 (Service Unavailable) response. It can contain either a number of seconds or an HTTP date."
}
```

## Question 8

```json
{
  "question": "What is the purpose of the 'X-Request-ID' header?",
  "options": [
    "To identify the request type",
    "To provide a unique identifier for request tracing",
    "To identify the client",
    "To identify the server"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": "To provide a unique identifier for request tracing",
  "explanation": "The X-Request-ID header provides a unique identifier for request tracing across distributed systems. It helps correlate logs, debug issues, and track requests as they flow through multiple services."
}
```

## Question 9

```json
{
  "question": "What is the purpose of the 'X-RateLimit-*' headers?",
  "options": [
    "To specify rate limiting rules",
    "To provide rate limiting information to clients",
    "To enforce rate limiting",
    "To configure rate limiting"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": "To provide rate limiting information to clients",
  "explanation": "X-RateLimit-* headers (like X-RateLimit-Limit, X-RateLimit-Remaining, X-RateLimit-Reset) provide clients with information about their rate limiting status, helping them manage their API usage effectively."
}
```

## Question 10

```json
{
  "question": "What is the purpose of the 'X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff' header?",

    "To enable content type sniffing",
    "To configure content type handling"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": "To prevent content type sniffing",

}
```

    "To specify XSS protection rules"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": "To enable XSS protection",
  "explanation": "The X-XSS-Protection header enables the browser's built-in XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) protection. It can be set to '1' to enable protection or '1; mode=block' to enable protection and block the page if an attack is detected."
}
```

    "To enable security features"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": "To enforce HTTPS connections",
  "explanation": "The Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS) header tells browsers to only connect to the site using HTTPS, even if the user types HTTP. This prevents protocol downgrade attacks and cookie hijacking."
}
```

## Question 14

```json
{
  "question": "What is the purpose of the 'Content-Security-Policy' header?",
  "options": [
    "To specify content security rules",
