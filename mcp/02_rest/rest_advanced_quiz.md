---

## Question 1

```json
{
  "question": "What is the primary architectural benefit of implementing HATEOAS in a REST API?",
  "options": [
    "Improved performance through caching",
    "Client-server decoupling and API discoverability",
    "Better security through token validation",
    "Reduced bandwidth usage through compression"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": "Client-server decoupling and API discoverability",
  "explanation": "HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State) primarily provides client-server decoupling by making APIs self-documenting and discoverable. Clients can navigate the API dynamically without hardcoded URLs, allowing the server to evolve without breaking clients."
}
```

## Question 2

```json
{
  "question": "In a microservices architecture, what is the most effective way to implement API versioning for backward compatibility?",
  "options": [
    "URL versioning (/api/v1/users)",
    "Header versioning (Accept: application/vnd.api+json;version=1)",
    "Content negotiation with custom media types",
    "Query parameter versioning (?version=1)"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": "Content negotiation with custom media types",
  "explanation": "Content negotiation with custom media types (e.g., 'application/vnd.company.users-v1+json') is most effective for microservices because it allows multiple versions to coexist, provides clear semantic meaning, and follows REST principles while maintaining backward compatibility."
}
```

## Question 3

```json
{
  "question": "What is the optimal caching strategy for a REST API serving frequently updated user profile data?",
  "options": [
    "Cache-Control: public, max-age=3600",
    "Cache-Control: private, max-age=300, must-revalidate",
    "Cache-Control: no-cache, must-revalidate",
    "Cache-Control: public, max-age=86400"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": "Cache-Control: private, max-age=300, must-revalidate",
  "explanation": "For frequently updated user profile data, 'private, max-age=300, must-revalidate' is optimal because it allows short-term caching (5 minutes) for performance, ensures private caching only, and requires revalidation to ensure data freshness."
}
```

## Question 4

```json
{
  "question": "What is the most secure approach for implementing OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow in a REST API?",
  "options": [
    "Store access tokens in localStorage",
    "Use PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) with authorization code flow",
    "Implement implicit flow for SPAs",
    "Use client credentials flow for all applications"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": "Use PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) with authorization code flow",
  "explanation": "PKCE with authorization code flow is the most secure approach because it prevents authorization code interception attacks, doesn't expose tokens in URLs, and provides additional security for public clients while maintaining the benefits of the authorization code flow."
}
```

## Question 5

```json
{
  "question": "What is the optimal strategy for handling large file uploads in a REST API?",
  "options": [
    "Use multipart/form-data with direct upload",
    "Implement resumable uploads with Content-Range headers",
    "Use chunked transfer encoding",
    "Implement server-sent events for progress tracking"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": "Implement resumable uploads with Content-Range headers",
  "explanation": "Resumable uploads with Content-Range headers are optimal for large files because they allow upload resumption after failures, provide progress tracking, and handle network interruptions gracefully while maintaining REST principles."
}
```

## Question 6

```json
{
  "question": "What is the most effective pattern for implementing real-time updates in a REST API?",
  "options": [
    "Long polling with repeated GET requests",
    "Server-Sent Events (SSE) with EventSource",
    "WebSocket connections for bidirectional communication",
    "Polling with exponential backoff"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": "Server-Sent Events (SSE) with EventSource",
  "explanation": "SSE with EventSource is most effective for real-time updates in REST APIs because it provides efficient one-way communication, automatic reconnection, built-in event handling, and works over standard HTTP without requiring protocol changes."
}
```

## Question 7

```json
{
  "question": "What is the optimal approach for implementing pagination in a REST API with large datasets?",
  "options": [
    "Offset-based pagination (?page=1&limit=20)",
    "Cursor-based pagination with opaque tokens",
    "Keyset pagination with timestamp-based cursors",
    "Page-based pagination with total count"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": "Cursor-based pagination with opaque tokens",
  "explanation": "Cursor-based pagination with opaque tokens is optimal for large datasets because it provides consistent performance regardless of dataset size, handles concurrent updates gracefully, and doesn't expose internal data structure while maintaining REST principles."
}
```

## Question 8

```json
{
  "question": "What is the most secure way to implement rate limiting in a REST API?",
  "options": [
    "IP-based rate limiting only",
    "User-based rate limiting with API keys",
    "Multi-dimensional rate limiting (IP, user, endpoint)",
    "Token bucket algorithm with sliding windows"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": "Multi-dimensional rate limiting (IP, user, endpoint)",
  "explanation": "Multi-dimensional rate limiting provides the most security by considering IP address, user identity, and specific endpoints. This prevents abuse from multiple angles while allowing legitimate users appropriate access levels."
}
```

## Question 9

```json
{
  "question": "What is the optimal strategy for implementing API gateway authentication in a microservices architecture?",

    "Use shared session storage across services",
    "Implement token introspection at each service"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": "Validate tokens at the gateway and pass user context",
  "explanation": "Validating tokens at the gateway and passing user context is optimal because it centralizes authentication logic, reduces latency by avoiding repeated token validation, and provides consistent security across all microservices."
}
```

    "Client-initiated key rotation",
    "Automatic key generation without notification"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": "Graceful rotation with overlapping validity periods",

    "Code comments and README files",
    "Postman collections"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": "OpenAPI/Swagger with interactive testing",
  "explanation": "OpenAPI/Swagger with interactive testing provides the most comprehensive documentation because it offers machine-readable specifications, interactive testing capabilities, automatic client generation, and keeps documentation synchronized with API implementation."

```json
{
  "question": "What is the optimal strategy for implementing API data validation?",
  "options": [
    "Client-side validation only",
    "Server-side validation only",
    "Multi-layer validation approach",
    "Database constraint validation only"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": "Multi-layer validation approach",
