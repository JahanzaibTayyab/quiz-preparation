## Question 1: E-commerce API Architecture

```json
{
  "scenario": "You're designing an e-commerce API that needs to handle product catalog, inventory, orders, and user management. The system must support 10,000+ concurrent users, real-time inventory updates, and integration with multiple payment gateways. Which architectural approach would you choose?",
  "options": [
    "Monolithic REST API with all endpoints under /api/v1/",
    "Microservices with separate APIs for products, orders, users, and payments",
    "Event-driven architecture with REST APIs and message queues",
    "GraphQL API with REST endpoints for external integrations"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": "Event-driven architecture with REST APIs and message queues",
  "explanation": "Event-driven architecture with REST APIs and message queues is optimal for this scenario because it provides loose coupling between services, enables real-time inventory updates through events, supports high concurrency through asynchronous processing, and allows independent scaling of different components while maintaining REST principles for external integrations."
}
```

## Question 2: API Rate Limiting Strategy

```json
{
  "scenario": "Your API is experiencing abuse from automated bots making 1000+ requests per minute. You need to implement rate limiting that's fair to legitimate users while preventing abuse. What's the most effective approach?",
  "options": [
    "Simple IP-based rate limiting: 100 requests per minute per IP",
    "User-based rate limiting with API keys: 1000 requests per hour per user",
    "Multi-dimensional rate limiting: IP + User + Endpoint + Time window",
    "Token bucket algorithm with sliding window and adaptive limits"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": "Multi-dimensional rate limiting: IP + User + Endpoint + Time window",
  "explanation": "Multi-dimensional rate limiting provides the most effective protection because it considers multiple factors simultaneously. It prevents IP-based attacks while allowing legitimate users appropriate access, considers endpoint-specific limits (e.g., stricter limits on expensive operations), and uses time windows to prevent burst attacks while maintaining fair usage."
}
```

## Question 3: Caching Strategy for Financial Data

```json
{
  "scenario": "You're building a financial API that provides real-time stock prices, historical data, and portfolio information. Stock prices change every second, but historical data is static. What caching strategy would you implement?",
  "options": [
    "Cache everything for 1 hour with Cache-Control: public, max-age=3600",
    "No caching due to real-time nature of financial data",
    "Tiered caching: real-time data (no cache), historical data (long cache), portfolio (short cache)",
    "Cache all data for 5 minutes with aggressive invalidation"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": "Tiered caching: real-time data (no cache), historical data (long cache), portfolio (short cache)",
  "explanation": "Tiered caching is optimal for financial data because it recognizes that different types of data have different update frequencies. Real-time stock prices shouldn't be cached, historical data can be cached for hours/days, and portfolio data can be cached briefly (1-5 minutes) to reduce database load while maintaining reasonable freshness."
}
```
