-   [ ] Use microservices architecture with service mesh for flexible component replacement
-   [ ] Create abstraction layers that isolate business logic from implementation details
-   [ ] Use event-driven architecture with loose coupling between system components

**Explanation:** Modular architecture with plugin systems provides maximum flexibility while API-first design and evolutionary schemas ensure compatibility as the system evolves to meet future requirements.
