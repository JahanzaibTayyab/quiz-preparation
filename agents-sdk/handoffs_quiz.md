```json
{
    "question": "A fintech company uses OpenAI Agents Python SDK to route customer queries. The Triage agent hands off refund requests to a Refund agent using the handoff() function. What is the default tool name exposed to the LLM for this handoff?",
    "options": [
        "transfer_to_refund_agent",
        "handoff_refund",
        "refund_tool",
        "delegate_to_refund"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "transfer_to_refund_agent",
    "explanation": "By default, Handoff.default_tool_name() generates 'transfer_to_<agent_name>' (docs: 'Creating a handoff'). Others are not the default naming convention."
}
```

```json
{
    "question": "You want to ensure that when a handoff occurs, the new agent does NOT see any previous tool calls in the conversation history. Which built-in helper should you use?",
    "options": [
        "handoff_filters.remove_all_tools",
        "handoff_filters.strip_history",
        "handoff_filters.clear_context",
        "handoff_filters.remove_agent_messages"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "handoff_filters.remove_all_tools",
    "explanation": "remove_all_tools removes all tool calls from history (docs: 'Input filters'). Others are not valid or do not exist."
}
```

```json
{
    "question": "A support workflow involves a Triage agent that delegates to Billing and Refund agents. The product owner wants to customize the tool description for the handoff to the Refund agent. Which parameter should be set in the handoff() function?",

        "tool_description_override",
        "tool_name_override",
        "description",
        "handoff_description"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "tool_description_override",
    "explanation": "tool_description_override customizes the tool description (docs: 'Customizing handoffs via the handoff() function'). Others are incorrect or not valid parameters."
}
```

```json
{
    "question": "A developer wants to execute custom logic (e.g., logging, data fetch) immediately when a handoff is invoked. Which handoff() parameter enables this?",

        "pre_handoff",
        "handoff_callback",
        "before_transfer"

        "Set on_handoff to check for 'reason'"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "Set input_type to a Pydantic model with a 'reason' field",
    "explanation": "input_type enforces structured input (docs: 'Handoff inputs'). Others do not enforce input schema at the API level."
}
```
