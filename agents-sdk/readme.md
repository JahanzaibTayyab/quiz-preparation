# OpenAI Agents SDK Quiz Preparation

This repository contains advanced quizzes and scenario-based questions to help you master the [OpenAI Agents SDK](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/).

## What is the OpenAI Agents SDK?

The [OpenAI Agents SDK](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/) enables you to build agentic AI apps in Python with powerful primitives for agents, handoffs, guardrails, tracing, and more. It is designed for production use and supports complex workflows, orchestration, and validation with minimal abstractions.
